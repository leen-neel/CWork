# C Work

Just like [JavaWork](https://github.com/leen-neel/**javawork**) this repo was made so that I can look at this years later and realize the pain I had to endure.

# Things to do

# How to run the programs

If you're still here and want to run the C programs I wrote, use `run.py` like this:

- Make the script an executable:

```bash
chmod +x ./run.py
```

- Run the program you want to run:

```bash
./run.py Basics/hello.c
```

## ⚠️ Note

Note that I'm using Bash. Running these commands might be different if you're using PowerShell/cmd on Windows.
